          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Nestl√© accidentally invented Milkybar in 1936 when kitchen staff
            added cocoa butter to a batch of Nestrovit, a vitamin-enriched
            condensed milk for children. Milkybar production stopped during
            World War II due to shortages of milk and sugar. In the 2000s, the
            recipe was improved to use only natural ingredients.
