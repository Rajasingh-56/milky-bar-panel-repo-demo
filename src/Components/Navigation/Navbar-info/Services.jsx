            Milkybar Wowsomes, a chocolate with 30% less sugar than other Nestlé
            chocolates was released in 2018. The sugar content was reduced by
            processing sugar to be aerated and porous. According to Nestlé, as
            this would dissolve faster in the mouth, it would be perceived as
            sweet as regular Milkybar chocolate.[9] They were released to meet
            consumer demand for healthier products. Wowsomes were discontinued
            in mid-2019 after achieving low sales. A Nestlé representative said
            this was as the chocolates were not as creamy as traditional
            Milkybar chocolate

            Milkybar Mix Ups were launched in 2019, an assortment of white
            chocolate buttons with a cocoa filling, and milk chocolate buttons
            with a cream filling. They were made using a similar production
            technique to Rolo chocolates, on the same production line.[11]

            In Australia and New Zealand, Milkybar does not contain cocoa
            butter, and is therefore not labelled as chocolate.[12]

            Milkybar is particularly popular in South Africa. The local version
            of Milkybar is a white chocolate-like confection made with milk
            powder, sugar, and vegetable fats (palm, shea nut, and illipe seed),
            produced by Nestlé South Africa. While listed as "white chocolate"
            on Nestle's website[13] and by some retailers,[14] Milkybar in South
            Africa does not contain cocoa butter, a defining ingredient in true
            white chocolate.
